# MCP Server Program Structures (Python)

This repo demonstrates 4 ways to write a Python MCP server using the [FastMCP](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp) framework. Pros and cons of each approach are highlighted. FastMCP was selected over the [MCP SDK for Python](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk) because it's ahead in functionality and actively maintained.
